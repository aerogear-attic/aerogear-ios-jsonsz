# aerogear-ios-jsonsz

**This library is deprecated**

For an alternative library, I would recommend you look at:

* [ObjectMapper](https://github.com/Hearst-DD/ObjectMapper), similar to jsonsz and created around the same time: library to serialize/deserialize JSON into objects.
* [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON) to deal with immutable JSON (easily accessible via subcript json["person"]["name"]).
